### **End to End ISRCTN analysis** Link to Repository: [ISRCTN Analysis](https://github.com/Rachit-R/Explore_ISRCTN)
- Personal aim: Utilise python to automate SQL queries. Strengthen SQL fundamentals, Data Manipulation and Data Query. Visualise data in a meaningful way in Tableau. Track project via Git.
- Project involved end-to-end process of handling, cleaning, analysing, and visualizing clinical trial data.
- Main objective is to extract insights from a clinical trials dataset and present the findings through a Tableau dashboard.
- The process includes downloading a CSV file, cleaning and transforming the data, loading it into an SQLite database, executing a series of SQL Manipulation statements within the DB browser to better categorise some data, automating various SQL queries to generate CSV files for visualization in tableau.

### **Interactive visualisation of Clinical Trial Data**
- Personal aim: Create an interactive dashboard of clean clinical trial data.
- Cleaned and visualised UK-based clinical trial data (1995-2023) from the ISRCTN registry, revealing trends in trial initiation and condition category distribution.  
The project involved cleaning and visualizing clinical trial initiation data from the ISRCTN registry, focusing on trials initiated with UK recruitment from 1995 to 2023.  
Created dashboard in Tableau which shows trial initiation over time and distribution of trials across different condition categories per selected year
