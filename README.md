- Aim: Utilize Python to automate SQL queries, strengthen SQL fundamentals, perform data manipulation and queries, and visualise data meaningfully in Tableau. Project tracking was managed via Git.
- Scope: The project covered the end-to-end process of handling, cleaning, analysing, and visualising clinical trial data.
- Objective: Extract insights from a clinical trials dataset and present the findings through a Tableau dashboard.
 - Process:
   1) Downloaded a CSV file containing clinical trial data.
   2) Cleaned and transformed data.
   3) Loaded data into an SQLite database.
   4) Used SQL manipulation statements to better categorise data.
   5) Automated various SQL queries to generate CSV files for visualisation in Tableau.



### **Interactive visualisation of Clinical Trial Data**
- Aim: Create an interactive dashboard of clean clinical trial data.
- Cleaned and visualised UK-based clinical trial data (1995-2023) from the ISRCTN registry, revealing trends in trial initiation and condition category distribution.  
The project involved cleaning and visualizing clinical trial initiation data from the ISRCTN registry, focusing on trials initiated with UK recruitment from 1995 to 2023.  
Created dashboard in Tableau which shows trial initiation over time and distribution of trials across different condition categories per selected year
